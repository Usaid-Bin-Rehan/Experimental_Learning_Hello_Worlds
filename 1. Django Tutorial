Django is used for Python Web Development and Model Deployment - both of which I will also cover in Fundamental Learning

Firstly, I installed Python from https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.7/python-3.8.7.exe and checked the box of adding it to the PATH.
Then I wrote pip install django==2.1.5 on Command Prompt
Then I wrote django-admin on Command Prompt

Then I wrote django-admin startproject mysite
Then I visited its location in C/Users/Hp/mysite and it contained manage.py and mysite folder which contained three .py files
This a primary application that will point to other applications
Then I right clicked and opened command window there

Then I wrote py -3.8-32 manage.py startapp main to create a main core aspect of website
Then I visited the nysite folder and it contained a main folder which contained six .py files and migrations folder which contained a .py file
Then I wrote py - 3.8-32 manage.py runserver on command prompt which then showed me http://... of server

Then I copied the urls.py file from mysite and paste it in the main folder
First I edited the urls.py of mysite folder:
from django.urls import path, include 
path('',include('main.urls')), before the other path

Then I replaced the lines after from django.urls import... in the urls.py of main folder by:
from . import views
appname = "main"
urlpatterns = [
path("",views.homepage,name="homepage"),
]

Then I replaced the content of views.py file in main by:
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse
# Create your views here.
def homepage(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello World by <strong> Usaid Bin Rehan <strong>")
