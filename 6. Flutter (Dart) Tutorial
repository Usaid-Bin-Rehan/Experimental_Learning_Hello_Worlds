Flutter is used for App Development and below is the main file coded in Dart programming language

1. Go to flutlab.io and in the statelesshelloworld directory's subdirectory lib, there will be a main.dart file containing code:

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() => runApp(MyApp());

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget 
{
  // This widget is the root of your application.
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) 
  {
    return MaterialApp
    (
      // Application name
      title: 'Hello, World!',
      // Application theme data, you can set the colors for the application you want
      theme: ThemeData
      (
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      // A widget which will be started on application startup
      home: MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
  }
}

class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget 
{
  final String title;

  const MyHomePage({@required this.title});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) 
  {
    return Scaffold
    (
      appBar: AppBar
      (
        // The title text which will be shown on the action bar
        title: Text(title),
      ),
      body: Center
      (
        child: Text
        (
          'Hello World by Usaid Bin Rehan',
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
