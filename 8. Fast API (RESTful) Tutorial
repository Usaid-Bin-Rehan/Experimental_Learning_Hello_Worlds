FastAPI is the best RESTful API and I will also cover RESTful APIs in Fundamental Learning

1. Go to Google Colab and type each paragraph in a different cell:

!pip install colabcode
!pip install fastapi

from colabcode import ColabCode
from fastapi import FastAPI

cc = ColabCode(port=12000, code=False)

app = FastAPI()
@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
  return {"message": "Hello World in FAST API by Usaid Bin Rehan"}

cc.run_app(app=app)

2. Then click on https://......ngrok.io blue coloured underlined link and it will open API in  new tab
